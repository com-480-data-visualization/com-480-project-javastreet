## Milestone 1 (Friday 3rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**
### 1. Dataset

### 2. Problematic

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
We started the exploration of the dataset with some basic statistics to have a general idea of we were dealing with. You can find all the initial analysis on the Python notebook `analysis.ipynb` with some comments that describe the processing.

The dataset was generally clean and ready to used. However there were… doublons blabla jsp

### 4. Related Work
We can easily find a few plots showing the most successful apps on the stores. However most of them are only based on the number of downloads. After starting to explore the dataset (cf. part 3), we started to think of a more complete score, meaning that our ranking of the most successful apps will not only be based on the downloads but also on other criteria such as ratings or comments. This way, we could maybe have faithful ranking of the apps success.

And what if in addition to that you are building an app and you want to see if it’s likely to reach success on the Google Play Store? This is a question we asked ourselves, which made us include a small Machine Learning part in our project making our approach original. Indeed, based on the characteristics of the apps that we will consider as successful, we will try to predict the success of a custom app that you will design by choosing its characteristics (price, size, category…). You will thus be able to adjust the parameters as you wish, and maybe try to find the secret formula of an app’s success!
